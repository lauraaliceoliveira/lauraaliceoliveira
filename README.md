## Hi, I'm Laura! 👋

I’m a front-end developer with over 3 years of experience creating modern web applications and improving user experiences. I specialize in technologies like JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Angular, and have a solid understanding of tools like Node.js, MongoDB, and Prisma to work on full-stack solutions when needed.

I’m skilled in building responsive and accessible interfaces, optimizing performance, and integrating APIs to deliver fast and user-friendly applications. I also have experience with state management, design systems, and UI/UX principles, ensuring every project is functional and visually appealing.

Let’s build something great together! 😁
